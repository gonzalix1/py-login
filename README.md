# py-login
Python script that allows you to sign up and log in using MySQL. It's really easy and could be installed in larger projects.

This script is interesting because to store passwords uses SHA512 and substitution cipher with a randomly generated salt stored in the database.

If you have any doubt, please let me know.    
(This is my first script, so any advice is welcome)
